<strong>About</strong>
<div id="about">
	<p>1. Index I generates "new words" by affixing Greek & Latin prefixes to (an approximation of) all the nouns in the English language.</p>
	<p>We are using two sets of nouns, one is "all nouns", which consists of 55,191 words, and a smaller set of m which we are calling "some nouns", which consists of 1525 more common words.</p>
	<p>The nouns are taken from the <a href="https://wordnet.princeton.edu/" target="blank">WordNet database</a>.</p>
	<p>Defintions sourced from <a href="https://www.wiktionary.org/" target="blank">Wiktionary.org</a></p>
	<p>2. Text generator places the "new words" randomly in a range of texts of different genres and forms, using the NLTK to identify common nouns, and runs a Markov chain algorithm to generate new hybrid texts.</p>

	<blockquote>"By virtue of this science the poet is the Namer, or Language-maker, naming things sometimes after their appearance, sometimes after their essence, and giving to every one its own name and not another's, thereby rejoicing the intellect, which delights in detachment or boundary. The poets made all the words, and therefore language is the archives of history, and, if we must say it, a sort of tomb of the muses. For, though the origin of most of our words is forgotten, each word was at first a stroke of genius, and obtained currency, because for the moment it symbolized the world to the first speaker and to the hearer. The etymologist finds the deadest word to have been once a brilliant picture. Language is fossil poetry. As the limestone of the continent consists of infinite masses of the shells of animalcules, so language is made up of images, or tropes, which now, in their secondary use, have long ceased to remind us of their poetic origin. But the poet names the thing because he sees it, or comes one step nearer to it than any other. This expression, or naming, is not art, but a second nature, grown out of the first, as a leaf out of a tree. What we call nature, is a certain self-regulated motion, or change; and nature does all things by her own hands, and does not leave another to baptise her, but baptises herself; and this through the metamorphosis again. I remember that a certain poet described it to me thus:
	<br>
	<br>Genius is the activity which repairs the decays of things, whether wholly or partly of a material and finite kind. Nature, through all her kingdoms, insures herself. Nobody cares for planting the poor fungus: so she shakes down from the gills of one agaric countless spores, any one of which, being preserved, transmits new billions of spores to-morrow or next day."
