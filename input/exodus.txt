1 And these are the names of the sons of Israel who came to Egypt; with Jacob, each man and his household came:

2 Reuben, Simeon, Levi, and Judah.

3 Issachar, Zebulun, and Benjamin.

4 Dan and Naphtali, Gad and Asher.

5 Now all those descended from Jacob were seventy souls, and Joseph, [who] was in Egypt.

6 Now Joseph died, as well as all his brothers and all that generation.
