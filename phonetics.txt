- revisiting phonetics stuff with tom
	- original ideas for generating speech were very ambitious, the theory is simple but the output is ridiculously complex
	- nltk is good at analysis, doesn't do generation
	- markov, cfg or neural net for generation, but we don't have good input 
	- start with proof of concept approach, take on poem/translation and map phonetic changes/similarities
	- think about source languages and output goals

questions for linguist (9.17.2017)
- what are limitations or possible problems of combining two random phonemes
	- markov chain as possiblity (may need to explain)
- collisions based on phoneme similarities in different languages
- syllabus structure (first slides)
- sonority sequencing principle (second slides)
- constraints, things that don't occur in english and aren't possible
- imaginary set of phonotactical rules?  
	- no rules with ipa in different languges
	- mix rules of different languages
- robert kosic
- ipa landscape changes with english vs other languages
- inputting a starting syllable or a few syllables

skype call with luke
- nepali subject marking, corpus stuff
- s-side and p-side
	- phonetics and phonology
	- syntax and morphology
- universal linguistics
- historical linguistics
	- sound change that happened after norman conquest
	- english mixed with french, made it modern
	- added french phonemes, pleasure/leisure
	- mixing of inventories
- nepali royal languges
	- only for nepali royals
	- mixed nepali persian
- model of entire language and phonemic/syllabic inventory
	- know about phontactics of language
		- what syllables are possible
	- do it for another language, how to combine
- language and dialect
	- constructs self imposed, things are always fuzzy
	- political reasons for different languages
	- urdu and hindi are the same
	- chinese all different but called chinese
	- disinction is mutual incomprehensibility
	- gradients of understanding, asymmetric
	- portugese understand spanish, not vice versa
	- sound changes influenced by other languages shared by region
- phonetics vs phonology
	- phonetics about sounds
		- produced and percieved
		- physical restrictions
		- some things that are difficult
		- ie clicks take a lot more work
	- phonology representation in brain
		- inventory of sounds
		- sounds are continuous
		- gradient of T
		- ipa is rough approximation of all sounds
	- phonotactics how they're combined
		- nt as beginning is physically possible, just doesn't happen in english
		- difficult to imagine other languages without these rules
- naivest thing to do
	- phonemic inventories of two languages, combine randomly
	- random phonemes won't be pronouncable
	- take syallable structure into account
	- combine rules in an interesting way
- different classes of phonemes, more or less vowel like
	- outisde syllables are less vowel like
- sound properties, voicing
	- place of articulation
	- different places of the mouth
	- manner, level of constriction
	- difference between p and b
	- articulated in same place - but humming
	- n vs t, some air goes through nose on n
	- english - cccvcccc strenghts
	- economy vs semantic specificity
- um, discourse marker, has a meaning
	- meaning of "like"
- orthography 
	- unlike language, innaccurately repoducing sounds in language
	- CMU arpanet to IPA - typing easier
	- python modules varying accuracy
	- CMU mostly correct
	- arpabet is for english

- http://espeak.sourceforge.net/download.html
	- try brew install espeak
- https://github.com/bootphon/phonemizer
	- looks promising but a million fucking dependencies
- https://github.com/rhdunn/cmudict-tools // could be useful? description tooo looong
- http://www.photransedit.com/Online/Text2Phonetics.aspx // online transliterate (also windows desktop app)
- https://github.com/dmort27/epitran // seems good so far
- http://upodn.com/phon.php // english to IPA
- english to IPA // https://github.com/mphilli/English_to_IPA

4.24.2020
- look at what's new?
- https://www.ipachart.com/
- need to map the ipa character from the text (transliterated by epitran) to the videos
	- can manually name videos or map characters in json chart
	- how do i know its accurate?
	- voicing and mapping videos is different

4.27.2020
- trying to make input for phonetics
	- epitran requires cmu flite, not sure how to include that on heroku
	- worry about this after we actually decide this is worth pursuing

4.28.2020
- where did hebrew ipa come from?
	- i think i just made it by copying and pasting into a site

# to dos
# - more espeak parameters: http://www.masswerk.at/mespeak/
# - print transliterated text? i don't think epitran does this https://github.com/dmort27/epitran
#	- something else
